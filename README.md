This project was done as an examination work in the course: Programmering 2. The course was part of the program Data-och systemvetenskapligt kandidatprogram.

**About this program:**

The program allows the user to open a map (a background image)and with mouse clicks define places on the map. The places have names, can have a descriptive text and can belong to one of the three categories Bus, Underground or Train. They can also be without category. The places can be of two types: NamedPlace (has only one name) or DescribedPlace (has one name and a description). The user can show, hide, remove and search for places.
